In this game, the goal is to shoot at sheep before they cross the railroad, beacuse otherwise you will end the game.

Following the tutorial, I added scripts to make the wheels rotate, the hay to move from one side to another, shoot, and create sheeps iteratively.

Also, sound was added and indicators for killed sheep in the top of the screen
